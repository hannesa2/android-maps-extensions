Android Maps Extensions
=======================

Library extending capabilities of Google Maps Android API v2.  
While [Google Maps Android API v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/)
is a huge leap forward compared to its predecessor,
it lacks commonly used patterns like marker clustering.
This library aims to fill this gap by adding many useful features
and improving on the responsiveness issues of the official Google library.

Usage
=====

You may use any version of [Google Play Services](https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html) from 3.2.65 (the last working on Android API 8) or above.

Gradle
------

```Groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

```Groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.hannesa2:android-maps-extensions:$latest'
}
```
